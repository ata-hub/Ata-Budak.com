      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p> From beginning of the end of middle school up to end of high school, I have worked every summer in several places
        to gain work experience and be productive. Below are the places I worked in my summers.
      </p>
      <li><b>July –August 2016	PRATIK MATEMATİK 	Education Toolkits Importer</b></li>
      <p>	The company is importing, translating and distributing science and mathematics education toolkits and board games for children. 
        Its web site is www.aklimiseverim.com. In the first two weeks, me and my twin brother helped the company to move to a different 
        address by packing, carrying and reorganizing all office materials including books and education toolkits
        We translated the toolkits and board games from English to Turkish. 
        We shot marketing videos explaining how to play and use these toolkits. Videos are available on YouTube at Aklimi Severim Channel. 
      </p>
      <li><b>June 2016	ERGEN GOLD AND JEWELLERY	Gold Accessories Manufacturer</b></li>
      <p>The company is manufacturing gold bracelets and wedding rings. There are 8 workers at the workshop and 6 salespersons at the wholesale shop. I and my brother worked at the workshop. 
        In the first two days we observed the artisans and the process of gold bars turning into bracelets. 
        Then we helped with;<br></br>
        o	Melting gold at more than 1.000 OC,<br></br>
        o	Moulding process,<br></br>
        o	Production of gold sheets and wires. <br></br>
        We polished the end products to be ready for display at the wholesale shop or to be sent to retailers. <br></br>
        We carried gold and bracelets between the workshop and the wholesale shop. <br></br>
        </p>
        <li><b>June – August 2014	ERKAN-CENGİZ-NURETTİN BARBERS	Men’s Barber Shop</b></li>

          My responsibilities were; <br></br>
          o	Cleaning the shop; floors, mirrors and the sinks. <br></br>
          o	Greeting the clients; helping them take off and put on jackets. <br></br>
